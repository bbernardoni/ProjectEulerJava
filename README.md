# Project Euler Java

This contains the solutions to Project Euler problems 1-65 solved in Java

### About

From the Project Euler website:

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than 
> just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, 
> the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
> 
> The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind 
> to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

### Development

Delevolpment was started on August of 2013. Since then I have also completed up to 60-80  in both C++ and haskell.
